## 🎯 What is Unami Foundation Moments App?

### The Digital Notice Board for South Africa

**Unami Foundation Moments App** is your community's digital notice board - where neighbors share what matters most through WhatsApp.

#### What is a "Moment"?

A **Moment** is any piece of community information that deserves to be amplified:
- 💼 Job opening at the local shop
- 🚨 Safety alert about road closures
- 🎓 Free training opportunity
- 🎉 Community event announcement
- 🏥 Health clinic schedule changes
- 🌱 Environmental initiative

**Think of it as:** The community notice board that used to hang at the local shop or church - now accessible to everyone via WhatsApp.

## 🤔 How Are We Different?

### vs. Chatbots
**We're NOT a chatbot.** We don't pretend to answer your questions or have conversations.

**We ARE:** A community amplification service. Real people sharing real information with their neighbors.

| Chatbots | Unami Moments |
|----------|---------------|
| AI pretends to be human | Real humans sharing real info |
| Answers questions | Shares community opportunities |
| One-on-one interaction | One-to-many broadcasting |
| Generic responses | Hyper-local, relevant content |

### vs. Social Media
**We're NOT social media.** No likes, no comments, no endless scrolling, no algorithms hiding your posts.

**We ARE:** Direct community signal - important information delivered straight to your WhatsApp.

| Social Media | Unami Moments |
|--------------|---------------|
| Algorithm decides what you see | You choose your regions & interests |
| Endless scrolling & distraction | Focused, relevant updates only |
| Public profiles & tracking | Privacy-first, minimal data |
| Global noise | Hyper-local signal |
| Ads disguised as content | Sponsored content clearly labeled |

### vs. WhatsApp Groups
**We're NOT a WhatsApp group.** No group chat chaos, no off-topic conversations, no phone number exposure.

**We ARE:** Curated community broadcasts with verified sources and trust signals.

| WhatsApp Groups | Unami Moments |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Everyone sees everyone's number | Your number stays private |
| Anyone can post anything | Verified sources with trust levels |
| Off-topic chaos | Focused, relevant content |
| No moderation | Content reviewed for quality |
| Group admin controls everything | You control what you receive |

---

### Understanding Trust Levels (Explainer)
